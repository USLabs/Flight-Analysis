# Flight-Analysis
* Analysis of Flight Data in order to answer various questions regarding flights 
  eg- in which season when are planes delayed, etc 
* Using Hadoop MapReduce and Apache Spark in order to have a flavour of both and compare their usages as well. 
* Using Cloudera QuickStart virtual machine image for Docker. Use Hadoop cluster offered by image locally. For Apache Spark 
  solution, I used Apache Spark in standalone mode.
